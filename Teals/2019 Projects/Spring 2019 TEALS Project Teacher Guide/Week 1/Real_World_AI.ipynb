But what do each of them really mean?\n\n## Artifical Intelligence (AI) and Cognitive Computing\nCognitive computing and AI are both used to help humans understand the world around them and make better decisions in complex scenarios. Since this area of computer science is rapidly growing, the definitions are still changing, but there is a way to understand the difference. \n\n### Cognitive Computing\nCognitive computing includes a set of tools and methods that provide mimic human logic, often at a larger and faster scale, to enable humans to make decisions at a larger and faster scale. For example, one of the cognitive computing services that you will be introduced to in this project is Text Sentiment Analysis. This is a service where you provide a sentence such as `This video game is so much fun!` and the cognitive service will give you a sentiment score between 0 and 1. The close to 1 the score is, the more likely the sentence is a positive one, so this example sentence might return a score between 0.9 and 1. Though a human could easily let you know if that sentence is positive or negative, it can be useful for a cognitive service to give you that information because then you could send in hundreds of thousands of sentences and get the average score for them in a matter of minutes. For example, let's say you sent the cognitive service all of the tweets about the finale of Game of Thrones, you could get the average sentiment analysis score and see if people generally liked the episode or didn't like the episode. This information is useful for people writing scripts and deciding what shows to air, and would have taken weeks for humans to do it.\n\n### Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence is slightly different from cognitive computing in that it tends to combine many factors to actually make a decision so that a human doesn't have to. Let's take that same example from the explanation on cognitive computing, an AI might combine the reception of a finale episode on Twitter with the words in a script, the plot, the network, the demographics of viewers, the time the show aired, the recent political and social headlines, etc to make decisions on whether the finale of a _different_ show should be changed, and if so, how it should be changed. You've likely encountered an AI if you've ever called an automated service that allowed you to speak in natural language (e.g. English) and it helped you to schedule an appointment or provide basic customer service. \n\n### Cognitive Computing VS Artificial Intelligence\n#### - Cognitive computing is meant to interface with and think like humans to aid human decisions\n#### - AI is meant to solve problems and make decisions for humans\nIn this project, you will only be dealing with cognitive services, but you should be thinking about how the pieces you are exploring in the next couple of weeks could be combined and enhanced to create an AI to help the world in some way. Below you will find examples of AI for good.\n\n![alt text](https://www.intelegain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/xDistinguishing-between-cognitive-computing-AI1-672x370.jpg.pagespeed.ic.A8EgGx6nmS.jpg \"Elephants\")\n## Artificial Intelligence Examples\nHere are some examples of AI in our life today. Some are everyday uses and some are socially conscious applications.\n\n### Saving Elephants\nThere are fewer than 500,000 elephants left on earth. Asian elephants are _endangered_, with fewer than 40,000 remaining.\n\n![alt text](https://1gew6o3qn6vx9kp3s42ge0y1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/122/2018/08/WWF-C-Krista-Lyons.jpg \"Elephants\")\nPoaching is a huge problem. Every year >20,000 elephants are killed. The illegal ivory trade promotes this behavior.\n\nMicrosoft's AI for Earth program is implementing cloud and AI tools that are leading these important efforts to create change. From using acoustic monitors to track elephants and their wellbeing, to using AI in the creation of predictive techniques that alert rangers of poaching patterns so they can mitigate issues before a crime can take place. \n- Acoustic monitors to track elephants and their wellbeing\n- AI observes and predicts poaching patterns\n- Alerts rangers to step in BEFORE the crime happens\n\n### Music Recommendations\nMusic services pay attention to the songs that you listen to and the ones that you skip. AI uses that data to make song recommendations.\n\nMusic services already know what you are and everyone else on the platform are listening to. They use AI to recommended Songs, Albums, and Playlists. This is also really effective for suggesting New Releases, which is also useful for new artists who may not have an audience yet.\n\n![alt text](https://spotify.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62207iFCA28C284B277399/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999 \"Music\")\n\nGoogle Play also offers personalized music recommendations. Its AI-powered suggestions take into account factors like weather, time of day, and whether you're at home or at work to offer music that can set the mood for activities. For example, you might be offered a playlist of dance music on a Friday night, or soft acoustic music on a rainy day.\n\n\n### Autonomous and Connected Electric Vehicles\nAI-guided autonomous vehicles (AVs) will enable a transition to mobility on-demand over the coming years and decades. Substantial greenhouse gas reductions for urban transport can be unlocked through route and traffic optimisation, eco-driving algorithms, programmed “platooning” of cars to traffic, and autonomous ride-sharing services. Electric AV fleets will be critical to deliver real gains.\n\n![alt text](https://media2.govtech.com/images/940*562/Connected+Autonomous+Vehicles.jpg \"AVs\")\n\n\n### Bing/Google Predictive Searches\n\nWhen you begin typing a search term and the search engine makes recommendations for you to choose from, that’s also AI in action. You start typing, the search engine will finish your query with the likely words based on the content of what you're searching for, what others have searched for, and many other factors that are part of the secret AI that each search engine has built.\n\n![alt text](https://redjamal.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/4535133806_21780d9aa4.jpg \"Google\")\n\n\n### Chatbots\n\nChatbots recognize words and phrases in order to (hopefully) deliver helpful content to customers who have common questions. Chatbots attempt to mimic natural language, simulating conversations as they help with routine tasks such as booking appointments, taking orders, or answering billing questions. Sometimes, chatbots are so accurate that it seems as if you’re talking to a real person.\n\nEver chatted with a company online? That was probably a chatbot. Chatbots are trained with common questions to answer (FAQs). They are given a flow for each conversation (skill). All to try and help you (or sell you something),\n\nA recent survey jointly conducted by BBC Earth and Berkeley University, revealed that watching nature documentaries can trigger happiness. That was a real “aha!” moment for BBC Earth, and one that fuelled the launch of the Real Happiness project. Real Happiness is simple – users interact with a Messenger chatbot, which then sends them personalized animal videos. It’s purpose is to bring people and nature closer together.\n\n![alt text](http://www.hotsaucedrops.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bbc1.jpg \"Chatbot\")\n\n![alt text](http://www.hotsaucedrops.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bbc4-577x1024.jpg \"Chatbot\")\n\n\n### Smart Agriculture\n\nAI-augmented agriculture involves automated data collection, decision-making and corrective actions via robotics to allow early detection of crop diseases and issues, to provide timed nutrition to livestock, and generally optimise agricultural inputs and returns based on supply and demand. \n\n![alt text](http://www.netralnews.com/foto/2018/09/19/428-ilustrasi_smart_farming_40-696x341.jpg \"Smart Agriculture\")\n\nThis promises to increase the resource efficiency of the agriculture industry, lowering the use of water, fertilisers and pesticides which cause damage to important ecosystems, and increase resilience to climate extremes.\n\n### Product Recommendations\n\nOnline retailers, such as Amazon, use AI to gather information about your preferences and buying habits. Then, they personalize your shopping experience by suggesting new products tailored to your habits. Sometimes you also provide information to help the online retailer identify products that are more likely to match what you're looking for. On Stitch Fix, or similar clothing apps, you input information about your body type and size and the types of clothes you like and dislike. An AI then provides choices to a \"Styler\" who will use that information to narrow down the selection to just 5 items. \n\nBelow is an example of AI-powered recommendations on Amazon.com.\n\n![alt text](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-27-at-15.07.36.png \"Product Recommendations\")\n\nWhen you search for an item such as “Bose headsets,” the search engine also shows related items that other people have purchased when searching for the same product.\n\n\n### Maps and Directions\n\nWhen apps like Google Maps calculate traffic and construction in order to find the quickest route to your destination, that’s AI at work. Maps will gather data on current traffic and historical traffic patterns, your past destinations, your home and work location, the time of day, and probably much more to optimize your route. The AI can extend beyond one app as well, if you use Google Maps and Google Calendar you might get notifications such as \"Your next appointment is at X and it will take you Y minutes to get there with current traffic, it is recommended you leave in the next Z minutes to arrive on time\".\n\nIn the example below, Google Maps offers directions based on the fastest route according to the usual traffic.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Ie1ay0LFB5qrwz0s.png \"Maps and Directions\")\n\n### Smart Disaster Response\nAI can analyse simulations and real-time data (including social media data) of weather events and disasters in a region to seek out vulnerabilities and enhance disaster preparation, provide early warning, and prioritise response through coordination of emergency information capabilities. Deep reinforcement learning may one day be integrated into disaster simulations to determine optimal response strategies.\n\n![alt text](https://newsroom.cisco.com/documents/10157/14740/drones-disaster-rt-feature_1200x675_hero_082718.jpg/957a7d8c-d15d-46c7-ae8f-ec7a150dd474?t=1535403257558 \"Smart Disaster Response\")\n\n### Ride-sharing Apps\n\nRide-sharing services such as Lyft use AI to determine how long it will take to get from your location to your destination. This lets you know when to expect a driver or food delivery.\n\nIn May 2017, ZDNet tech news website published a report that revealed how Uber uses artificial intelligence to set prices based on what they think you might be willing to pay. This would include the length of your trip, the wait time for a driver, and the destination.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*SikeFJ58Woe-Oya6.png \"Ride-sharing Apps\")\n\nA recent report by The Independent claims that Uber is developing artificial intelligence that will help determine if a rider has been drinking — before the driver agrees to pick up the passenger. This AI-powered software would attempt to determine a rider’s state by analyzing and comparing patterns of typing, walking speed, and other factors.\n  \n### Helping the Earth\nHere are some areas of focus for AI that helps the Earth:\n![alt text](https://github.com/danhermes/cognitive-hackathon/blob/master/images/Week%201/Areas-of-focus.gif?raw=true \"Focus\")\n\nAnd a timeline:\n![alt text](https://pwc.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451623c69e20223c849dd65200c-pi \"Focus\")\nSource: PwC\n"
