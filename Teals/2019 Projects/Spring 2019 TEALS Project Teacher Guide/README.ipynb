Azure Notebooks will be presented and worked with in a hands-on lab. Python fundamentals will be presented as well, along with a lab. Real-world Artificial Intelligence (AI) examples will be presented.\n\n## [Week 2](https://spring2019tealsproject-sguthals.notebooks.azure.com/j/notebooks/Week%202/README.ipynb)\nFirsthand cognitive examples will be presented. The course project begins: Students will brainstorm their project concept and choose an idea. They will group into teams to choose specific ideas to develop. Requirements, applications, and technical considerations will be discussed. Live Python code example of spell check cognitive service will be presented.\n\n## [Week 3](https://spring2019tealsproject-sguthals.notebooks.azure.com/j/notebooks/Week%203/README.ipynb)\nTeacher demonstrates Cognitive API code examples to prepare students for Computer Vision and Text Analytics Labs. Students will implement their cognitive concept in the course project and form conclusions.\n\n## [Week 4](https://spring2019tealsproject-sguthals.notebooks.azure.com/j/notebooks/Week%204/README.ipynb)\nStudents will present their Project Conclusions. They will discuss considerations with data and apply these to their project. Additional cognitive services may be experimented with.\n\nTo get started, clone this Azure Notebook:\n<img width=\"1346\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-24 at 5 33 31 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1314285/56659754-c6ca2a00-6652-11e9-9a23-377baf2adb33.png\">"
