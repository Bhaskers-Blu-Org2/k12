They then create a summary of their project, including data inputs and JSON outputs and interpretation, as well as their conclusions. This will be presented to the class first thing next week.\n\n## Teacher Instructions: Project Summaries (60 mins)\n(This exercise is in the students' Week 3 folder in their [Project Conclusions notebook](https://sp19tealsazureproject-sguthals.notebooks.azure.com/j/notebooks/Week%203/ProjectConclusions.ipynb).)\nStudents will work in their teams to summaries their results and conclusions from their project. These results should go into their notebooks to use for presentations next week. Summaries should answer these questions:\n\n### Project Goals\nWhat is the goal of the project?\nWho would benefit from this idea? How?\nWhat are the challenges?\n\n### Cognitive Services\nHow will cognitive services help make the project a reality?\nAre the provided cognitive services sufficient to meet the projects requirements? If so then how? In not then what more is needed?\nWhat are the important aspects of the cognitive analysis that must work in order for the project to succeed?\nWhat are some of the risks in using cognitive services for this project?\n\n### Data Sets\nWhat data sets (images, text) would be necessary to make this project a success?\nWhat will be the sources of that data and how will it be gathered?\n\n### Project Output and Result\nWhat are the outputs of this project? Decisions, analysis, data, etc.\nWho will use this output? How?\nWhat would constitute useful output?\n\n### Conclusions\nWhat were the successes in this project? What were the challenges?\nWhat would be the best case scenario for the success of this project? How would it affect the world?\n\n### New Directions\nWhat were some of the best ideas that came up for other projects?\nWould those also use cognitive services or something else?\n\n## Summary\nStudents created project summaries for presentation in the next class.\n"
