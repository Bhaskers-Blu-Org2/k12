# Teals End of School AI Projects
[Microsoft's TEALS Program](https://www.bing.com/search?q=teals&cvid=a9203c701fe04428b8c6a1d3237e623a&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531) stands for Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS) and is a Microsoft Philanthropies program that connects classroom teachers with tech-industry volunteers to create sustainable CS programs. Volunteers support teachers as they learn to teach CS independently over time.

## About these Post-AP-Exam Project
As part of the continued support for AP CS A TEALS Teachers, we have built post-AP-Exam projects to further students' learning in computer science, but with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In this folder, you will find two projects. Though we recommend the 2020 project, we want to ensure all curriculum remains available for use. 

### 2020 AI Project with JavaScript
With this project, we aim to provide an exciting alternative to the current end-of-year curriculum which allows students to combine Azure AI libraries with interactive animations, and game development, culminating in a self-led student project that integrates basic computer vision, voice recognition, and/or text analytics.

Throughout this TEALS project, students will be able to explore Azure Cognitive Services to create their own creative interactive web-based project. Students will be exposed to:
- JavaScript
- Azure Cognitive Services
- API Keys
- Animation/Game Development
- Ethics of AI

### 2019 AI Project with Python
Azure Cognitive Services are a set of intelligent algorithms that give your apps the power to see, hear, speak, understand, and interpret what your users need through natural communication. Basically, the ability to easily add AI to any simple application youâ€™re building. 

Watch Dr. Sarah Guthals give an intro to this project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zGi2k59cXo&feature=youtu.be).

Through this pilot TEALS project, students will be able to explore Azure Cognitive Services to get an idea of the vast ideas they could bring to life with the power of Azure. Students will be exposed to:
-	Python
-	Azure Notebooks (Jupyter Notebooks)
-	Azure Cognitive Services
-	API calls 
-	App Design
-	Ethics of AI

Students will be asked to form groups and come up with an idea for an app that would use Azure Cognitive Services for social good.
