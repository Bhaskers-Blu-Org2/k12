# K-12 Azure Educator Resources
Azure Education can include a number of different areas. This repository will be kept up to date with various projects and lessons that are likely to be a good fit for novices in the K-12 space.

# Current Offerings
## Student Zone at Build 2020
Microsoft's professional developer conference where, you guessed it, professional developers come to confer! By that, we mean where developers come to learn about how Microsoft can better support their unique developer journey. There were technical sessions, opportunities to meet and talk with experts, and the chance to discover and grow a technical community.

Each year at Microsoft Build we create a session track specifically aimed at student developers. The target age for our student developers is 14-21 years old, though that is really just there to guide us in scoping the content we create for you. So if you're a bit outside of these exact ages, you still might find this content useful for your coding journey! This may be perfect for you if you're a career switcher or a even just a beginner! Learn more about the [Student Zone here](https://github.com/microsoft/StudentsAtBuild).

## What other resources does Microsoft have for students?
### Microsoft Student Learn Ambassadors
Microsoft Student Learn Ambassadors are a global group of on-campus ambassadors who are eager to help fellow students who lead in their local tech community, and develop technical and career skills for the future. You might find yourself organizing a hackathon to solve the world’s toughest problems, mentoring fellow students, or unlocking the next great idea with your team — it’s all up to you. If you are a student at university who is actively looking to teach others and empower your community, then do sign up!

### Imagine Cup
For nearly two decades, students from around the world have participated in Microsoft’s global technology competition, the Imagine Cup, to bring their unique tech solutions to life. But the Imagine Cup is more than just a competition — you can work with friends (and make new ones!), network with professionals, gain new skills, make a difference in the world around you, and get the chance to win cash and cloud credits. Join the over 2 million students who have participated in the [Imagine Cup](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/)!

Here's a [podcast with the Program Manager of the Imagine Cup, the 2018 world champion and a finalist from 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf46_35E2KM).

### Imagine Cup Jr
Imagine Cup Junior 2020 is an opportunity for students aged 13 – 18 to learn about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and create an AI for Good concept that they think could make a positive impact on the world around them.  The top 3 teams (1 - 6 students per team) from each region will receive a Windows 10 device each, an Imagine Cup Junior trophy and a group mentoring session with a Microsoft Vice President.

Students can learn more about AI and build their projects live via our Imagine Cup Junior Teams events:

### Microsoft Learn for Students
Learn new concepts at your speed and on your schedule. Start here to develop practical skills through fun, interactive modules and paths. Plus, educators can get access to Microsoft classroom materials and curriculum. Check out all of the Microsoft Learn [paths and resources](http://aka.ms/learnforstudents).

## Azure for Students Starter
A free Azure account with access to educational services and no credit card required to sign up. You can learn more about
it [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/starter/)

## Azure for Students
A free Azure account plus a $100 credit for students 18+ and no credit card required to sign up. You can learn more about it
[here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)

## Introduction to Data Science
We've developed a ~30 hour workshop for adults interested in learning about Python and Data Science, but this curriculum is also effective for high school students. You can find this [here](https://github.com/microsoft/reactors)

## Introduction to AI
As part of Microsoft TEALS, we offer a 4-week project for students to experiment with Azure Cognitive Services. Students
can quickly start exploring how these services can give insight to complex data such as images. Visit the project
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/k12/tree/main/Teals/README.md)

## Image Data Predicting Climate Change
In collaboration with HackingSTEM and NASA, we have a introduction to Machine Learning for middle and high school students. With
Excel and a simple web app, students can learn about how color in images can help us understand how our climate is changing, 
and then mimic a machine learning model to understand how Azure helps do this at scale. Check out the lesson [here](https://preview.education.microsoft.com/hackingStem/lesson/nv3zo6ad) and the machine learning demo [here](https://nasa-on-azure.azurewebsites.net/)

# Deprecated
## Minecraft Multiplayer VM
To give more access to Minecraft: Education Edition Multiplayer experience to more schools, we have launched an Azure VM so that
educators do not have to have a high-end machine to be able to have their entire class connect and collaborate on Minecraft. 
Learn about it [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/host-multiplayer-minecraft-education-edition-on-azure-virtual-machines/)
